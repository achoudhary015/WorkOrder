1. Files (inputs,Dependencies)

This program takes two text files, an orders.txt with a list of
order numbers in a store, and dependencies.txt, which shows  
how some orders are connected to/rely on other orders.
These connections between orders are currently presented poorly.


Each order has an id, a name and dependencies 

2. Output

Generated a file that shows all work orders and their dependencies 

With this my program aims to make it easier to understand how these orders
are connected to Each other in Right way. 

3. library and Important Notes 

pip install pandas	(Important)
pip install matplotlib (optional) but recomended 

Input and output url in direction.py should be changed as per the user directory path 

To run the following program please  Run the following command 
python main.py 

After Compiling please check the output.txt file for the output Result

4. Testing 

You cange change the content of the inputs.txt file , Dependencies.txt to check teh Different result and Compair Different Result's 

I did the same thing to check the output and fix any bugs in the code !

5.	Unit tests and Integrated tests:

Many of the Manual tests can be further broken down to unit tests and integrated tests.
